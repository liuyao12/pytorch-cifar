    "# ResNet with a \"twist\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* As far as I'm aware, a simple and novel architecture of ConvNets (Convolutional Neural Networks) that is readily applicable to any existing ResNet backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The key idea would be hard to come by or justify without viewing ResNet as a partial differential equation (like the heat equation). Traditionally, the standard toolkit for machine learning typically includes basics of multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, and statistics, and not so much PDE. This partly explains why ResNet comes on the scene relatively late (2015), and why this enhanced version of ResNet has not been \"reinvented\" by the DL community.\n",
